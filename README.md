# Enumerable-Methods

Custom implementation of various enumerable methods existing in Ruby.

Each method is tested through different datasets and also with different configurations.

Efforts had made to mimic as close as possible the official behaviour of these methods provided in official Ruby documentation.

## Test

In the main.rb file some line of codes are there to test the functionality of each method. Just uncomment lines to see the result. Don't forget to uncomment the class declarations to make all things work correctly.
